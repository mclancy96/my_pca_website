# My Personal Website

Welcome to my Personal Webpage!

I've created this as a modified version of my personal website for PCA ([see the repo here](https://github.com/mclancy96/portfolio)). My main personal website uses Node.js as a server. To adapt this for the PCA, I've converted this to be compatible with GitHub pages as required by the assignment.

Thank you for your consideration for the PCA!
